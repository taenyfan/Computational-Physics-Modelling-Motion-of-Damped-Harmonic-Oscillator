# Computational-Physics-Modelling-Motion-of-Damped-Harmonic-Oscillator

This is a project for my Computational Physics course at the University of Manchester.

The primary aim of this project is to create an interactive program that calculates the time variation of a damped harmonic oscillator given initial conditions,
using analytical and numerical methods. The methods covered in this program are:
1. Analytical Method
2. Euler Method 
3. Improved Euler Method
4. Verlet Method
5. Euler Cromer Method

The time variation of the damped oscillator is represented by graphs of displacement, energy and velocity. This program also compares the 
accuracy of each numerical method by comparing them to the analytical solution. 

For extension, part II of the project calculates the solutions of damped harmonice motion with an instantaneous force applied at different 
phases of the motion.  Part III of the project calculates the solutions of damped harmonice motion with a sinusoidal force applied. Both 
part II and III are done using the Verlet Method.

All results can be found in the pdf file.
